# Dotfiles

My personal set of dotfiles. Currently contains:

- bash
- bspwm
- git
- polybar
- sxhkd
- system
- terminator (used before, keeping just in case)
- vim
- vscode

Used on Ubuntu 18.04, but will gradually move to something Arch-based.

## Installing

To install at least `stow` is needed.

1. `git clone git@github.com:Artemigos/Dotfiles.git -o ~/.dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/.dotfiles && ./restore`

## Todo

- ranger
- rofi
- vim (it's barely there right now)
- tmux?
- update `sp help` to include info about my new commands
